    "description": "Since humanity entered the new geological era called &quot;Anthropocene&quot;, where human deeds tend to unsettle the natural order the most, it’s worth enumerating the sites still unharmed by us. Practices with the aim of sustainable design are core to the green new deals we need to make collectively and every day to get a hold over an unassailable catastrophe. Let’s look at some good examples (and one of a shock!)",

Following the orange pathway 65 ecologically tended show gardens unfold in a patchwork of individual units such as „Recycling Garden”, „Floodplain forest garden paradise” or „Natural Farmacy”. Since its creation in 2008, Die Garten stood out as a role model for sustainable management, where organic life is catered for without the use of pesticides, synthetic fertilisers or synthetic peat. Instead, varied vegetation, beneficial organisms and biological agents are utilized in a resource-conserving manner. As a treat next to education, the  daily 10.45 o’clock water show addresses the theme „By The Beautiful Blue Danube”."},

Families thus torn apart were to go out of their way to get in touch with relatives and as the urban legend goes inventiveness was not out of the stock. On calm, windless evenings people would approach the river to have their words transmitted by the waves. Common sense had it right, as sound is amplified when it travels over water. Since then, the annual AquaPhone festival commemorates this beautiful myth by people entrusting their secrets to the Danube with contemporary performances, music and other attractions. This year the event falls on the 15th of June!"},

Underneath each of the whitewashed, ridge-roofed houses 10-30 m long cellars give place to the first phases of vinification: pressing, fermentation and refining. Since 2001 the civil Association of the Press House Owners undertook the tasks of architectural renovation, landscaping, the promotion of winemaking and tasting, the latter activity culminating during the Siller Festival end of May each year. The Sárgödör (Mudpit) cellar-village offers an insight into an age-old handicraft next to the town’s major landmarks, the more high-tech nuclear plant and Nuclear Energy Museum."},

It extends between the Danube River and the embankment in a length of 1 km. It is the only natural lake on the Danube created by the moving of the Danube riverbed. It was named after boats (“tikvare”), in which fishermen kept their fish. It flourished after the flood in 1965 when the trough is deepened. Tikvara beach is connected to the mainland by a small bridge so it is actually converted into a river island. The lake represents nautical, water sports, recreational and sport fishing centre. Backa Palanka is visited by the Danube regatta every year and the Kayak School is also known here. Tikavara lake has the great importance to the local population as one of the most attractive tourist potentials."},

Hydrological engineering such as dams caused the water level to rise with a sheer amount of 35 metres, as a consequence of which several villages and even a whole island were deliberately inundated. The total evacuation and destruction of the built heritage of the Turkish-speaking Ada Kaleh happened in 1971, an island that also inspired literary fiction to portray heaven on earth (Mór Jókai’s Golden Man). Rumor has it that at low water the peak of the mosque is still visible in the watery grave, where the Atlantis of the Danube is buried."},

Founded in 1974, its borders with Romania got precisely defined by 1983 (although nowadays international cooperation is fostered for mutual development of ecotourism et al). The management of the park considers various protection programs as it covers Important Bird Areas, Prime Butterfly Areas and is also in procedure of protection as a Biosphere Reservation by UNESCO. Sites of nature are variously spotted by prehistoric archeological sites, fortified objects from the Roman and Byzantine times and medieval war architecture."},

Painted blue they stand a neat contrast to traditional building materials used for thatched roofs. Letea is a village best approached through channels in between the floating reed islands, meandering on traditional rafts, passenger ships or fishing boats. The nearby forest enchant the visitors with high population of feral horses (under the label „Danube Delta horse” in Wiki), many of them set free after the downfall of communism. 400 years old oak trees, high dunes and clinging plants unique in Europe give the forest a Mediterranean look. Don’t go in alone, but call a Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Administrator to go with you!"}
